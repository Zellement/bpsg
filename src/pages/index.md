## Welcome to

## Birmingham Parent's Support Group

When discovering that a member of your family or a friend is gay, lesbian or bisexual it is often very distressing. It can be difficult to understand exactly what this means and how or why it affects you.\
\
BPSG is a voluntary organisation of parents of gay and lesbian children. We offer support to other parents and families when they discover a family member or friend is gay.\
\
You are not alone. We are all parents in similar circumstances. We have been through the emotions that you may be going through and asked the same questions as those you may be asking.\
\
We can listen and talk together about how we feel, all in complete confidence.
